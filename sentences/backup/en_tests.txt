Frank Sinatra does things personally. 

At Christmas time, he will personally pick dozens of presents for his close friends and family, remembering the type of jewelry they like, their favorite colors, the sizes of their shirts and dresses. 

When a musician friend's house was destroyed and his wife was killed in a Los Angeles mud slide a little more than a year ago, Sinatra personally came to his aid, finding the musician a new home, paying whatever hospital bills were left unpaid by the insurance, then personally supervising the furnishing of the new home down to the replacing of the silverware, the linen, the purchase of new clothing.

The same Sinatra who did this can, within the same hour, explode in a towering rage of intolerance should a small thing be incorrectly done for him by one of his paisanos.

For example, when one of his men brought him a frankfurter with catsup on it, which Sinatra apparently abhors, he angrily threw the bottle at the man, splattering catsup all over him. 

Most of the men who work around Sinatra are big. 

But this never seems to intimidate Sinatra nor curb his impetuous behavior with them when he is mad.

They will never take a swing back at him. 

To accomplish this would require the hiring of a special crew of painters to work all night, at overtime rates, which, in turn, meant that the order had to be bucked back up the line for further approval.

When it finally got back to Sinatra's desk, he did not know what it was all about.
